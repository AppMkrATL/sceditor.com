## Browser Compatibility <a id="browser-compatibility"></a>

By default if a browser doesn't support <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editing, the editor will be completely disabled leaving just the plain `textarea`. This only mobile browsers as all current desktop browsers support <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editing.

You can set the editor to run in source mode if there is no <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> support by setting the [runWithoutWysiwygSupport](http://localhost:8080/documentation/options/#runWithoutWysiwygSupport) to `true` editors in the constructor.
